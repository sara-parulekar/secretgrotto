hi gabriel!

i finally finished the typefoundry and the typespecimen yay!!

a couple things to note:
in order for full javascript functionality the way i envisioned it, i did have to look up a lot of code online. i did my best to relocate every source i used, and will link everything below! i also tried to comment on which parts of the code that i didn't do myself.

process:

to make the type foundry, i found that i work best with a visual reference.
i decided to scrap my previous process and just start again. my original plan was for the
type to go in a flexbox with other elements, but i quickly found that it was very difficult to use and code around. for my next go, i decided on a simple one-page vertical layout, with horizontal scrolling bars and animated type specimens.

i first created a quick mockup in adobe illustrator, with a gradient background, a body text typeface that i liked, and images that i wanted to use that matched the cleaner vibe i decided to go wiht for the website.

then, i began recreating this image in code. i added the colors i selected, each section (welcome, then the 3 typefaces, then a farewell message) was seperated by a horizontal scrolling bar, that indicated the 'depth' as you went deeper into the website. i also imported custom images for the little deep sea creatures in the scroll bar.

then i worked on each section, which was easier because we had gone over the code to use in class.

what was tricky was the animations, because javascript is not intuitive at all, and i had to research how to create the effects i wanted.

this was especially true for the type specimen. i really wanted to create one for my magic-inspired pixel typeface, and i wanted a fun interactive element. however, this required A LOT of javascript, so i had to research how to code it. but it's super fun, and i'm really pleased with the way it turned out!1!!1
